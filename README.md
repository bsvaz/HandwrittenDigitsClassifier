# Neural Network for MNIST

## Overview
This project leverages PyTorch to design a neural network aimed at recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Dataset: MNIST
- Libraries: PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib
- Files:
    - MNIST_Handwritten_Digits.ipynb: Main notebook with dataset processing and model training.
    - net.pt: Trained model.
- Topics Covered: Dataset loading, preprocessing, visualization, modeling, and model saving/loading.

## Background
This project is a component of the Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree provided by AWS AI & ML Scholarship 2022.
